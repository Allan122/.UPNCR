0 AD – form calendar “Gregorian Calendar” 
78 AD – Shaka Calendar, Shaka 1944 year is going on.

The year 1944 in the Shaka calendar (also known as the Shalivahana Shaka calendar) is mentioned as being currently ongoing because the Shaka calendar is an official Indian national calendar and is widely used alongside the Gregorian calendar in India.

### Understanding the Shaka Calendar:

1. **Shaka Era Origin:**
   - The Shaka era began in 78 AD, marking the victory of King Shalivahana over the Sakas. Hence, the Shaka calendar starts from 78 AD in the Gregorian calendar.

2. **Structure of the Calendar:**
   - The Shaka calendar is a solar calendar and its year aligns closely with the tropical year. It has 12 months similar to the Gregorian calendar.
   - The months in the Shaka calendar are:
     1. Chaitra
     2. Vaishakha
     3. Jyeshtha
     4. Ashadha
     5. Shravana
     6. Bhadrapada
     7. Ashwin
     8. Kartika
     9. Agrahayana (Margashirsha)
     10. Pausha
     11. Magha
     12. Phalguna

3. **Current Year Calculation:**
   - To find the current year in the Shaka calendar, you subtract 78 years from the current Gregorian year.
   - For example, the Gregorian year 2024 corresponds to 2024 - 78 = 1946 in the Shaka calendar.

### Why 1944 Shaka Year is Mentioned:
- If someone says that the Shaka year 1944 is currently ongoing, it indicates that the statement might have been made in a previous year (e.g., 2022 in the Gregorian calendar) when 2022 - 78 = 1944.
- It's important to note that the Shaka year starts on the 1st of Chaitra, which usually corresponds to March 22nd (March 21st in leap years) in the Gregorian calendar.

### Summary:
- The Shaka calendar is officially used in India alongside the Gregorian calendar.
- The Shaka era started in 78 AD.
- To find the current Shaka year, subtract 78 from the current Gregorian year.
- The reference to Shaka year 1944 would correspond to the Gregorian year 2022 (if the statement was made in that year).

As of now, if the current Gregorian year is 2024, the corresponding Shaka year is 2024 - 78 = 1946.

A century is a period of 100 years. When referring to centuries, the convention is to start counting from the year 1 AD. Here’s how centuries are calculated and referred to:

### Basic Calculation
1. **Start from Year 1 AD**: The first century includes the years 1 to 100.
2. **Subsequent Centuries**: Each subsequent century starts with a year ending in 01 and ends with a year ending in 00.

### Examples:
- **1st Century**: 1 AD to 100 AD
- **2nd Century**: 101 AD to 200 AD
- **3rd Century**: 201 AD to 300 AD
- And so on...

### Determining the Century of a Given Year
To determine the century of a given year:
1. **If the year ends in 00**: Divide the year by 100.
   - Example: 1900 / 100 = 19. The year 1900 is in the 19th century.
2. **If the year does not end in 00**: Divide the year by 100 and add 1 to the result.
   - Example: 2023 / 100 = 20.23. Round up to the next whole number, so 2023 is in the 21st century.

### Calculation Steps:
1. **Year ending in 00**:
   - 1700 / 100 = 17 → 17th century
   - 2000 / 100 = 20 → 20th century

2. **Year not ending in 00**:
   - 1701 / 100 = 17.01 → Round up to 18 → 18th century
   - 2021 / 100 = 20.21 → Round up to 21 → 21st century

### Special Note:
- There is no year 0 in the Gregorian calendar. The years immediately preceding 1 AD is 1 BC.

### Summary:
- **1st Century**: 1 to 100
- **2nd Century**: 101 to 200
- **3rd Century**: 201 to 300
- **Current Century (as of 2024)**: 21st Century (2001 to 2100)

![image](https://github.com/Allan122/UPNCR/assets/45638226/a60be265-51e1-458c-bdf0-970caa6d1a20)

The first Muslim invasion of the Indian subcontinent occurred in the early 8th century, led by Arab Muslim commanders. Here's a brief overview:

### Arab Muslim Invasions:
- **Sindh Invasion (712 CE)**:
  - The first significant Muslim invasion of India occurred in 712 CE when an Arab general named Muhammad bin Qasim invaded Sindh (present-day Pakistan).
  - Muhammad bin Qasim, who was dispatched by the Umayyad Caliphate in Damascus, conquered Sindh, including the important port city of Debal.
  - The invasion marked the beginning of Muslim rule in the Indian subcontinent and introduced Islam to the region.

### Key Points:
- **Motivation**: The primary motivation behind the Arab Muslim invasions was to expand the territories of the Islamic Caliphate and spread Islam.
- **Tactics**: The Arab invaders employed military strategies and tactics typical of their time, including siege warfare, cavalry attacks, and alliances with local tribes.
- **Consequences**: The conquest of Sindh paved the way for subsequent Muslim invasions and the establishment of Islamic Sultanates in different parts of India. It also facilitated trade and cultural exchanges between the Indian subcontinent and the wider Islamic world.

### Significance:
- The Arab Muslim invasions of Sindh marked the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the Indian subcontinent, with far-reaching implications for its political, social, and religious landscape.
- While the Arab conquest of Sindh did not immediately lead to the establishment of permanent Muslim rule over large parts of India, it laid the foundation for subsequent waves of Muslim invasions and the eventual establishment of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire.

### Summary:
The first Muslim invasion of the Indian subcontinent took place in 712 CE when Muhammad bin Qasim led an Arab army to conquer Sindh. This invasion marked the beginning of Muslim rule in the region and had significant implications for the subsequent history of India, leading to the establishment of Islamic Sultanates and shaping the cultural and religious landscape of the subcontinent.

- **Islamic Rule**:
  - The medieval period in India saw the establishment of Islamic Sultanates and the Mughal Empire.
  - Islam, introduced to India through trade and conquests, became a significant cultural and political force, leading to the spread of Sufism and the construction of mosques and Islamic monuments.

- **Hindu-Muslim Interactions**:
  - The interaction between Hinduism and Islam during this period led to syncretic traditions, cultural exchanges, and sometimes conflicts, as seen in the architecture, music, and literature of the time.

### Modern India: "19th to 20th Century - British Historian"

![image](https://github.com/Allan122/UPNCR/assets/45638226/02652851-0f16-48eb-a861-053d8ae06855)

After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal Empire entered a period of decline, marked by internal strife, succession struggles, and the emergence of regional powers. This decline eventually paved the way for the establishment of modern India through a series of historical developments:

### Rise of Regional Powers:
1. **Disintegration of Mughal Authority**:
   - Aurangzeb's prolonged rule and ambitious military campaigns had exhausted the resources of the empire.
   - After his death, the empire faced internal revolts, succession disputes among his sons, and challenges from regional governors.
   
2. **Emergence of Independent States**:
   - In the wake of Mughal decline, regional governors and local rulers began asserting their autonomy and establishing independent states.
   - Powerful states like the Marathas, Sikhs, Rajputs, and Nawabs of Bengal, Awadh, and Hyderabad expanded their territories and influence.
  

### European Colonialism:
1. **British East India Company**:
   - The British East India Company, initially established for trade, gradually expanded its control over Indian territories through a combination of diplomacy, military conquests, and economic exploitation.
   - The Battle of Plassey in 1757 and the Battle of Buxar in 1764 marked significant victories for the British, leading to their increased dominance over Bengal and other regions.

2. **French and Portuguese Influence**:
   - The French and Portuguese also had trading posts and settlements in India, although their influence was overshadowed by the British in the long run.

### Establishment of British Raj:
1. **Consolidation of British Control**:
   - By the early 19th century, the British East India Company had established control over large parts of India.
   - The company's administrative reforms, military prowess, and alliances with Indian rulers facilitated its consolidation of power.

2. **British Rule (1858–1947)**:
   - The Indian Rebellion of 1857 (also known as the First War of Independence) led to the British Crown assuming direct control over India from the East India Company.
   - The British Raj was characterized by economic exploitation, cultural assimilation, social reforms, and administrative centralization.

### Indian Nationalism and Independence:
1. **Rise of Nationalist Movement**:
   - The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the emergence of Indian nationalism, fueled by factors such as education, modernization, and resentment against colonial rule.
   - Figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Subhas Chandra Bose led movements for independence, advocating nonviolent resistance, civil disobedience, and armed struggle.

2. **Achievement of Independence (1947)**:
   - The Indian independence movement culminated in India's independence from British rule on August 15, 1947.
   - The partition of India led to the creation of two independent nations, India and Pakistan, based on religious lines.

### Formation of Modern India:
- The establishment of modern India can be traced back to the decline of the Mughal Empire, the consolidation of British rule, and the subsequent struggle for independence led by Indian nationalists.
- India's journey from colonialism to independence marked a significant turning point in its history, leading to the adoption of a democratic republican constitution and the emergence of a modern, independent nation-state.

- **Colonial Influence**:
  - British colonization of India brought Christianity to the subcontinent, leading to missionary activities and the establishment of Christian educational institutions and churches.

- **Nationalist Movements**:
  - During the struggle for independence, religion played a complex role. 
  - Figures like Mahatma Gandhi emphasized religious pluralism, and the Indian National Congress included members from diverse religious backgrounds.
  - However, communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims also surfaced, leading to the partition of India along religious lines in 1947.

- **Secularism**:
  - After independence, the Indian Constitution enshrined secularism as a fundamental principle, promoting religious freedom and equal treatment for all religions.
  - India's modern history includes efforts to maintain communal harmony while addressing challenges related to religious identity, caste discrimination, and social justice.

### Summary:
Religion has been a central aspect of Indian history, influencing social, cultural, and political developments across ancient, medieval, and modern periods. While ancient India witnessed the emergence of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, the medieval period saw the interplay of Hinduism and Islam, leading to syncretism and conflicts. In modern India, religious pluralism and secularism have been key principles, although challenges related to communalism and religious identity persist.

# **Importance of Ancient Indian History**
![image](https://github.com/Allan122/.UPNCR/assets/45638226/5f09cdc1-b3cd-4aea-888d-dc5b4b7963df)

## **Development of Culture:**
Ethnic groups such as Aryans, Indo-Greeks, Turks, etc contributed to the Indian Social system, art, and architecture.
**Hindu culture is made through various other culture's contributions. So they should respect every community.**
**e.g., Greek historians were the first who brought astronomy concepts to India. Every invader brings their culture along with them and they become a part of our Indian Society. Hora Shastra - Astrology**

## **Interaction:**
Pre-Aryan culture with Dravidian and Tamil, east with west culture gave a unique feature. Such as ideas of Pali and Sanskrit texts also appear in Sangam Literature.

## **Religion**
India has been the cradle of Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism which interacted among themselves to give different customs, languages, and styles of life.

### **India is not a Hindu Country, Why?**
There was a debate in the constituent assembly regarding the majority of Hindus wanted India to be a Hindu Country. Still, they did not make India a Hindu Country. 
**Reason -** They were aware of India's ancient past, and that **India was never a Hindu country. India was always a country of a composite religion.** In Ancient times apart from Hinduism, Buddhist kings, and Jain Kings were there and in Medieval India, we had Hindu Kings and Islamic Kings. So we cannot trace even in single period in History where India is a Hindu country. And when we cannot find a trace in History then we have no right to change aspects of our country. We have to continue our existence through history. 

### **If one religion becomes dominant. What happens?**
If one religion's dominance increases conservatism comes liberality becomes less. And when conservatism increases that is always a problem for the society.

## **Name of the Country**
**India was named Bharatvarsha after the name of an ancient tribe called the Bharatas.**

### **Does these names given to India?**

The term "Hind" has an ancient origin and has been used historically to refer to the Indian subcontinent. Here's a detailed explanation of its evolution:

### Origins and Evolution of the Term "Hind"

| **Aspect**                         | **Details**                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Proto-Indo-Iranian Origin**      | The term derives from the Proto-Indo-Iranian word "*Sindhu*" which means a large body of water, referring specifically to the Indus River. |
| **Vedic Reference (c. 1500-500 BCE)**| In the Vedic texts, "Sindhu" referred to the river Indus and the lands around it, emphasizing its geographical significance. |
| **Achaemenid Empire (c. 550-330 BCE)**| The Persians, who controlled parts of the northwestern Indian subcontinent, used "Hindu" (derived from *Sindhu*) to denote the people and the region around the Indus River. The Persians dropped the 'S' sound, rendering "Sindhu" as "Hindu". |
| **Greek Adaptation**               | The Greeks, who interacted with the Persians, adopted the term as "Indos" or "Indus" to refer to the river and the lands beyond it. Alexander the Great's historians used "India" for the subcontinent. |
| **Medieval Arab Influence**        | Islamic scholars and travelers from the Arab world called the region "Al-Hind," using "Hind" to refer to the people and the culture of the Indian subcontinent. |
| **Mughal and Persian Usage**       | During the medieval period, Persian was the court language in many parts of the Indian subcontinent, and the term "Hindustan" (land of the Hindus) became prevalent. |
| **Colonial Usage**                 | European travelers and colonizers, who arrived in India during the medieval and early modern periods, adopted and adapted local terms, leading to the widespread use of "India" derived from "Hind". |
| **Modern Usage**                   | In contemporary contexts, "Hind" is still occasionally used in cultural and historical references. For example, "Hindustan" is a term still used in some Indian languages to refer to India. |

### Timeline of the Term "Hind"

| **Period**         | **Development**                                                                                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vedic Period**   | The term "Sindhu" was used in Vedic texts to describe the Indus River and the region around it.          |
| **Achaemenid Rule**| Persian adaptation of "Sindhu" to "Hindu" to denote the region around the Indus River.                    |
| **Greek Influence**| Greeks adapted the term to "Indos" or "Indus," leading to the modern "India."                            |
| **Medieval Arabs** | Arab travelers and scholars used "Al-Hind" to refer to the Indian subcontinent and its culture.          |
| **Medieval Persia**| Usage of "Hindustan" became common to describe the land of the Hindus during the medieval period.         |
| **Colonial Period**| European usage of "India" solidified as a term for the subcontinent.                                      |
| **Modern Era**     | "Hind" and "Hindustan" are occasionally used in cultural, historical, and poetic references.              |
