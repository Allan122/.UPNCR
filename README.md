0 AD – form calendar “Gregorian Calendar” 
78 AD – Shaka Calendar, Shaka 1944 year is going on.

The year 1944 in the Shaka calendar (also known as the Shalivahana Shaka calendar) is mentioned as being currently ongoing because the Shaka calendar is an official Indian national calendar and is widely used alongside the Gregorian calendar in India.

### Understanding the Shaka Calendar:

1. **Shaka Era Origin:**
   - The Shaka era began in 78 AD, marking the victory of King Shalivahana over the Sakas. Hence, the Shaka calendar starts from 78 AD in the Gregorian calendar.

2. **Structure of the Calendar:**
   - The Shaka calendar is a solar calendar and its year aligns closely with the tropical year. It has 12 months similar to the Gregorian calendar.
   - The months in the Shaka calendar are:
     1. Chaitra
     2. Vaishakha
     3. Jyeshtha
     4. Ashadha
     5. Shravana
     6. Bhadrapada
     7. Ashwin
     8. Kartika
     9. Agrahayana (Margashirsha)
     10. Pausha
     11. Magha
     12. Phalguna

3. **Current Year Calculation:**
   - To find the current year in the Shaka calendar, you subtract 78 years from the current Gregorian year.
   - For example, the Gregorian year 2024 corresponds to 2024 - 78 = 1946 in the Shaka calendar.

### Why 1944 Shaka Year is Mentioned:
- If someone says that the Shaka year 1944 is currently ongoing, it indicates that the statement might have been made in a previous year (e.g., 2022 in the Gregorian calendar) when 2022 - 78 = 1944.
- It's important to note that the Shaka year starts on the 1st of Chaitra, which usually corresponds to March 22nd (March 21st in leap years) in the Gregorian calendar.

### Summary:
- The Shaka calendar is officially used in India alongside the Gregorian calendar.
- The Shaka era started in 78 AD.
- To find the current Shaka year, subtract 78 from the current Gregorian year.
- The reference to Shaka year 1944 would correspond to the Gregorian year 2022 (if the statement was made in that year).

As of now, if the current Gregorian year is 2024, the corresponding Shaka year is 2024 - 78 = 1946.
